# Computing with Text: Final Project

The final project (the last two labs) is our chance to apply what we
have learned this semester about *computing with text* to a problem
that is interesting to you!


Your project should have elements of **text-based user interfaces**
and **natural language processing**, but the exact mix is up to
you. You can also expand upon any of the labs we did this
semester. The scope of the project should be at least a two-week lab,
but feel free to go beyond.

In addition to your code and documentation, you will also submit a
write-up describing your project as a markdown document. You should
address the *what*, *why*, *how* and *who* of the project. You can
work alone or with a partner. **You must cite any resources you used
to develop your project**.

## Deadlines

- **April 22 (by class)**: Project Idea (email Keith & Rich)
- **April 24 (by lab)**: Project Proposal (`proposal.md`)
- **May 1 (by lab)**: Work in Progress
- **May 8 (by midnight)**: Final Write-up and Code  (`writeup.md`)

## Assessment

Your project will be judged on the following criteria:

- **Proposal (4)**: Description of *what* and *why*.
- **WIP (4)**: Work-in-Progress demonstration.
- **Ambition (4)**: Ambition of project idea and implementation.
- **Creativity (4)**: Creativity of the project idea and implementation.
- **Execution (8)**: How much of your vision was accomplished successfully.
- **Style (4)**: Coding design, implementation, and documentation.
- **Write-up (8)**: Completeness & clarity.


## Project Types (ideas, not exhaustive)

- Natural Language Processing
    - information retrieval
	- predictive text
	- authorship detection
	- text summarization
	- sentiment analysis
	- question answering
	- topic modeling
	- chat bots
	- clustering	
	- visualization
	

- Text-Based User Interface
   - build your own CLI tool with a flushed out interface and
     documentation
   - build your own editor using [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html)
   - build a dataset viewer (think [`vd`](https://www.visidata.org/),
     but not that advanced)
   - build your own shell
   - text-based game  (consider: [curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html))
   - process the ascinema `cast` files
